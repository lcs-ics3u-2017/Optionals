 ![check-nil](check-nil.png)
 
 Run the playground.
 
 Ignore the yellow warning that appears.
 
 Focus on the result of the conditional statement.
 
 Is the result what you expected? Why?
 
 */
// Type the code below this line...


/*:
 
 Now change line 22 to look like this:
 
 ![set-monday](set-monday.png)
 
 Run the code again.
 
 Is the result *exactly* what you expected?  Look closely at the output.
