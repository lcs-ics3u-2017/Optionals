 ## Unwrapping optionals
 
 With this code:
 
 ![optional](optional.png)
 
 On line 1, a value was provided when the variable was initialized.
 
 On line 2, we checked for the absence of a value.
 
 On line 3, we printed the contents of the variable.
 
 However, the variable **dayOfWeek** remained an optional, and so it was shown as such in the output.
 
 How can we use **dayOfWeek** like a regular variable?
 
 We must *unwrap* the optional variable.
 
 Type the code you see below – note the changes on lines 3 and 4:
 
 ![force-unwrap](force-unwrap.png)
 
 */
// Type the code below this line


/*:
 
 Look closely at the output – **how does it differ from the output you obtained on Page 5**?
 
 Go back and check if needed.
